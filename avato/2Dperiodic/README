This software calculates the area contents and the length of the curved
outlines of cavities in configurations of spheres. That is, the holes which are
not covered by any sphere. More precisely, this is the code described and used
in the following publication:

  M. Schindler and A. C. Maggs:
  "Cavity averages for hard spheres in the presence of polydispersity and incomplete data"

COMPILATION:

1. For compiling and running this software you will need a copy of CGAL
   (www.cgal.org) and apply some minor modifications to it. Provided are
   patches for Version 4.4 of CGAL.
   For example:
     patch -p0 --posix < ~/avato/2Dperiodic/patches/patch_for_CGAL4.4

   The location where you installed CGAL should then be fixed explicitly in
   CMakeLists.txt as the variable CGAL_DIR.

2. Then call
   rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles cmake_install.cmake
   cmake . -Wno-dev
   make

3. Run the unit_tests binary to see if everything works fine.

4. Run the binaries for available volume or a.v. after takeout (avato) with a
   list of dumpfiles as arguments. The format of the dump files is freely
   defined, see the given examples and the source code for the definition.

   ./available_volumes data/dump.*.gz
   ./available_volumes_after_takeout data/dump.*.gz

   Output are textfiles of the formats
     "data/dump.*.av"
     "data/dump.*.avato"


FILES:

available_volumes.cpp : Calculates available-volume cavities from dump files
available_volumes_after_takeout.cpp : Calculates avato cavities from dump files
unit_tests.cpp : Do some internal tests, using data/dump.gz
read_dumpfile.h : Contains the implicit definition of the dumpfile syntax
*.h : Header files used in the remaining files
CMakeLists.txt : File to tell cmake what to generate
